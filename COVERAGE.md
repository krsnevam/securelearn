# Deck coverage

This file maps every slide in the program deck (*Agentic AI Security & Governance*, Modules 07–16) to where the app covers it.

**Tabs:**
- **Lab** is the main exercise.
- **Drill** is a Concept drills item.
- **Scen.** is a scenario card in the Scenarios tab.
- **Disc.** is the leadership discussion at the end of the Scenarios tab.
- **Home** is the home screen.

The scenario and discussion text, including the facilitators' model answers, is generated from the deck's own slides and speaker notes (`app/js/scenario-data.js`).
